What do snail shells, labyrinths, hurricanes, and history repeating itself have in common? An iconic symbol for centuries, the spiral reminds us of our roots and can be a powerful model for transformation in our lives. Explore this and more at the Soil Factory’s inaugural **Summer Solstice Festival**, a 6-day event featuring a multi-media, multi-sensory art exhibit, ***The Spiral Path: Tracing Our Way Forward***; activities for all ages; a presentation by distinguished artist Frances Gallardo, upcycled merch to purchase, and a spiral labyrinth to walk in contemplation. Join us **June 17-22** and help support this interconnected community of art, science, and sustainability.
