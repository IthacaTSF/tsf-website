The method of creating a fast-growing biodiverse forest of densely-planted native trees and shrubs was pioneered by a Japanese botany professor, Akira Miyawaki in the 1970s. He developed it to heal degraded land around factories, to connect the workers and their bosses to the beauty of nature.  Planting day was a festival when everyone in the corporation dug holes and put the trees theyâ€™d grown from seeds into the ground.

Many of these companies were multinational. Dr. Miyawaki organized a planting day at a Toyota factory in Bangalore, India. Subhendu Sharma was an engineer there, and was so taken with the idea that he left the factory and  became a forest engineer.  His  company, called  Afforestt,  spread the Miyawaki method around India and all the way to Europe.

A few years ago, the ecologist, Dr. Hannah Lewis, wrote Mini-Forest Revolution and these tiny forests began to pop up across the USA. The Soil Factory forest is a demo of the technique.  A pocket-forest can do the most good in an urban setting by creating an island of cooling, a connection to nature, and providing native habitat.  What if every elementary school had a mini-forest!

[Trees Up Tompkins](https://www.treesuptompkins.org) took the lead in the design and planting of the Miyawaki Forest in a recently abandoned corn field. They decided to try out 4 different soil treatments. Daniel Meyer designed the placement of trees and shrubs so that each of the 4 sections had a matched set of the 22 native species.  Dimensions are shown in meters.

**Measuring and Marking the Site**  
Volunteers use measuring tape to assess the dimensions of the field in the early stages of planning. This step was critical to ensuring that the layout of the future mini forest adhered to the precise design.

**Planning the Layout**  
Flags were labelled with the 22 species to be planted, then the 288 flags were placed according to the planting design.

**Guiding the Volunteers**  
The planting area is divided into 4 sectors marked with blue tape.  
Volunteers chose a sector and coaches explained the planting method for that team.

**A Family Affair**  
Children join the effort, lending a hand to plant sapling trees.

**Hands in the Soil**  
Coaches guided volunteers on the planting method. Each team applies a different soil amendment in their section of the circle:  compost from the town of Ithaca, compost+biochar, shown here, compost+biochar+living inoculum, and one sector with no amendment.

**Coordinated Planting and Watering**  
Volunteers work together, planting the designated species and carefully watering them with untreated well water.

**Final Preparations Before Planting**  
Blue tape divides the circle into 4 quadrants, each with the same species but different soil preparation. Flags show the future locations of 288 native trees and shrubs, as designed by landscape architect Daniel Meyer. This preparation was crucial to creating a balanced planting pattern.
